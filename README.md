# Effect-of-nSES-on-CVD

## Overview

This repository contains the code and interim used to generate results for the paper:

“Effect of Neighborhood Environment on Cardiovascular Disease Incidence and the Mediating Role of Individual Socioeconomic and Behavioral Features: The Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis and the Jackson Heart Study.”

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following directories:
* JHS/ – Contains data preprocessing and exploratory analysis scripts for JHS data.
* MESA/ – Contains data preprocessing and exploratory analysis scripts for MESA data.
* data_processed/ – Stores preprocessed datasets used for analysis.
* combined_analysis/ – Includes code for the final analysis combining data from both studies.

## Data Sources

The study leverages data from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) [1] and the Jackson Heart Study (JHS) [2] to examine the impact of neighborhood environments on cardiovascular disease (CVD) incidence and the mediating role of individual socioeconomic and behavioral factors.
